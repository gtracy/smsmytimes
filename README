This project has been used as a notification system for Madison's All City Swimming Championships.

The purpose of the app is to provide an SMS notification system for parents. When their child has completed their race,
they get notified with a text message that lets them know what their race time is as well as their overall rank in the race.

The app is built in Python and deployed to App Engine. It uses Twilio to interface with SMS.

There is some tedious, hand-wiring of results that needs to be done so it isn't terribly robus. I'm storing it here to give me revision control!
